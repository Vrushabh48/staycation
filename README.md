# Staycation Landing Page

This is the Staycation Landing Page, designed and developed from a Figma file reference. The goal was to create a visually appealing and functional landing page with a smooth user experience. It was an amazing experience building this from scratch, and this README will guide you on how to run the project locally.

## Project Overview

The Staycation Landing Page is a responsive web page designed for users looking for a perfect staycation experience. The page includes details about various staycation options, features, and offers. It has been designed with modern web technologies to ensure it performs well across all devices.

## Steps to Run Locally

Follow these steps to run the Staycation Landing Page on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
code staycation
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Next, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running:

npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages specified in the `package.json` file.

### 4. Run the Development Server
